# Grokking Algorithms Repository 🧠💻

Welcome to my Grokking Algorithms repository! This repository contains various algorithms implemented in different programming languages as I learn and practice them using the concepts from the book "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava.


### Introduction ℹ️

This repository serves as my personal collection of algorithm implementations based on the teachings from "Grokking Algorithms." Algorithms are the backbone of computer science and understanding them is crucial for problem-solving in software development. Here, I aim to solidify my understanding by implementing and experimenting with various algorithms.

### Algorithms Covered 🛠️

Some of the algorithms included in this repository (will be updated as I progress):

- Binary Search
- ... (More to be added)

### Folder Structure 📂

The repository is organized by programming language C++


### Usage 🚀

Each algorithm implementation is placed within its respective language folder. To use any of these algorithms, follow the instructions provided in the comments within each file.

### Contributing 🤝

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues, errors, or wish to add new algorithms or improvements, please feel free to open an issue or create a pull request. Please adhere to the repository's code of conduct.
